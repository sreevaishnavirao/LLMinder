1. IFEval
Description: IFEval is designed to evaluate a model's inferential reasoning capabilities, particularly its ability to deduce relationships and interactions between entities, events, or concepts. This benchmark is ideal for assessing logical reasoning and understanding in language models.
When to Use: Use IFEval when testing how well a model can infer connections and deduce implications from provided information. It is particularly suitable for tasks involving narrative reasoning, causality, or logical deduction.
Difference: Compared to other benchmarks, IFEval focuses more on reasoning and inference rather than domain knowledge or problem-solving in specific fields.

2. BBH (Big-Bench Hard)
Description: BBH is part of the Big-Bench Hard dataset, which includes challenging and diverse problems designed to evaluate advanced reasoning, creativity, and problem-solving. BBH covers tasks that require deep cognitive capabilities, often beyond surface-level understanding.
When to Use: Use BBH when assessing a model's ability to handle complex, open-ended, or unconventional tasks, especially those involving creativity and abstract thinking.
Difference: BBH is distinct in its focus on the hardest subset of tasks, making it a rigorous test of a model’s cognitive limits compared to other benchmarks.

3. MATH Lvl 5
Description: MATH Lvl 5 assesses a model’s ability to solve advanced mathematical problems, ranging from high school to early college-level topics, including algebra, geometry, calculus, and number theory.
When to Use: Use MATH Lvl 5 when testing a model's proficiency in handling mathematical reasoning and computations or when deploying models in education or STEM domains.
Difference: Unlike other benchmarks that test linguistic or general reasoning, MATH Lvl 5 specifically evaluates numerical, logical, and symbolic reasoning within mathematics.

4. GPQA (General-Purpose Question Answering)
Description: GPQA measures a model's ability to answer a wide range of questions spanning multiple topics and domains. It evaluates general knowledge, contextual understanding, and reasoning capabilities.
When to Use: Use GPQA for general-purpose applications like virtual assistants, chatbots, or information retrieval systems where broad knowledge and reasoning are required.
Difference: GPQA stands out by testing breadth (many topics) rather than depth in any single domain or specific reasoning skill.

5. MUSR (Multilingual Understanding and Semantic Reasoning)
Description: MUSR evaluates a model's ability to understand and reason across multiple languages. It focuses on semantic reasoning, including comprehension, translation, and context-based inference in a multilingual setup.
When to Use: Use MUSR when working on multilingual applications or testing a model's language understanding and semantic reasoning across different languages.
Difference: MUSR is unique in its multilingual focus, whereas other benchmarks like GPQA or IFEval are primarily monolingual or domain-specific.

6. MMLU-PRO (Massive Multitask Language Understanding - Professional)
Description: MMLU-PRO is a benchmark designed to evaluate professional and domain-specific knowledge. It tests a model's expertise in areas like law, medicine, and engineering, requiring precise, field-specific understanding.
When to Use: Use MMLU-PRO for domain-specific applications, especially in technical or professional fields where accurate and authoritative responses are critical.
Difference: MMLU-PRO focuses on domain-specific expertise, unlike GPQA, which tests general-purpose knowledge, or IFEval, which emphasizes inferential reasoning.
